This is a scheduling program to implement a Queue with two levels:
Level 1 : Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling
Level 2 : Round Robin Scheduling
For a Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling if one process P1 is scheduled and running   and another process P2 with higher priority comes. The New process with high priority process P2 preempts currently running process P1 and process P1 will go to second level queue. Time for which process will strictly execute must be considered in the multiples of 2.
All the processes in second level queue will complete their execution according to round robin scheduling.
In this program Queue 2 will be processed after Queue 1 becomes empty and Priority of Queue 2 has lower priority than in Queue 1.
